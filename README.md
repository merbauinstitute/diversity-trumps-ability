The Hong-Page model consists of three important components: (1) Problems  and problem characteristics (epistemic landscapes); (2) Agents; (3) Individual  problem solving; (4) Group formation; and (5) Group problem solving dynamics.

#### The Challenge
Problems and problem characteristics (epistemic landscapes): The ‘problem’ 
that the agents are trying to solve is represented through the epistemic landscape. The landscape consists of a set of two thousand points arranged in a ring 
such that the last point is adjacent to the first – once agents reach the 2,000th 
spot, they loop back to the first. In the original model, each point is randomly 
assigned a value between 0 and 1000 . Points with higher values are understood 
as better solutions to the problem
#### Agents
Each agent is assigned a random ‘heuristic,’ an ordered set of three 
natural numbers between one and twelve (e.g. [8,2,9]), which dictates how the 
agent moves around the landscape. The ‘maximum heuristic value’ is the greatest number that can appear in a heuristic. There are 1,320 possible heuristics 
using an ordered set of 3 unique numbers from 1 to a maximum heuristic value 
of 12. 

#### Individual problem solving
Problem solving is represented as movement 
across the landscape in search of the best solution (i.e. the point with the highest value). At any given moment an agent occupies a space with some value, 
but is looking to move to a better solution. To decide whether to move, the 
agent uses her first heuristic value, say ‘5,’ to probe the point five spaces to the 
right. If that point has a higher value than the one she currently occupies, she 
moves to it and repeats this procedure from her new spot using the next value 
in her heuristic. If the probed space has a lower value she stays on the original 
spot and tries her next heuristic value. She stops exploring the epistemic landscape when she cannot reach a higher point with any of the elements in her 
heuristic. 

#### Group problem solving dynamics: 
Both groups of nine agents move around the landscape as in a relay race. When the first group member gets stuck, the second agent tries out their heuristic, continuing until they get stuck, and so on. 
The group halts at the point at which no agent can identify a better solution. 
The ‘Diversity Trumps Ability’ result is the finding that groups of randomly 
selected agents regularly outperform groups composed of the nine individually 
best-performing agents (i.e. the group of randomly selected agents finds points 
with higher values).
